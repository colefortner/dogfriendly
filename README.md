## User Dashboard with their saved businesses
Also demonstrates friend connections and the the check in feature where you can see where your friends and their dogs currently are.  I was unable to complete the UI before the due date.

## User Profile Page
This was another UI casualty of time.  Currently the user can upload a picture for their avatar, and edit their bio.
