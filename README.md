# Dogfriendly

## Dogfriendly is my capstone project for All Aboard Ruby on Rails Bootcamp 
### (March 2021 - April 2021 cohort)

When I spent some time in St. Petersburg, Florida, one of the most enjoyable things about the city was the dog friendly bars, restaurants and beaches.  It had a small town feel and community where dog owners seemed to know each other and meet up randomly.  I thought it would be cool to have an app where users could rate places for their experiences as dog owners taking their dogs out and about.  I added a social media twist where an account owners can "friend" people they know on the app.  This feature allows account owners to check into businesses if they want their friends to know they are out, and open to socializing with their dogs.  Coming from a city that was not very pet friendly, I thought this might also help foster community in cities where pet friendly establishments are more sparse and often go unknown.  Note: I did not know a website already existed with the name when I created this.  While the name is the same, the purposes are very different.  My app is geared towards community, not travel.

## User Dashboard with their saved businesses
Also demonstrates friend connections and the the check in feature where you can see where your friends and their dogs currently are.  I was unable to complete the UI before the due date.

## User Profile Page
This was another UI casualty of time.  Currently the user can upload a picture for their avatar, and edit their bio.
